PROTOTYPE PATTERN EXPLANATION
=============================

OVERVIEW
--------
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that creates objects by cloning existing instances rather than creating new ones from scratch. It's useful when object creation is expensive or complex, and you want to create objects based on existing templates.

PATTERN EVALUATION: ✅ YOUR IMPLEMENTATION CORRECTLY FOLLOWS PROTOTYPE PATTERN
==============================================================================

Your implementation demonstrates a proper Prototype Pattern with all required components:

✅ PROTOTYPE INTERFACE: ProtoType<T> defines cloning contract
✅ CONCRETE PROTOTYPES: GamePiece and GameBoard implement cloning
✅ DEEP CLONING: GameBoard properly clones all contained GamePieces
✅ CLIENT USAGE: Main uses clone() instead of complex construction
✅ OBJECT INDEPENDENCE: Cloned objects are independent of originals
✅ TYPE SAFETY: Generic interface ensures type-safe cloning

PATTERN COMPONENTS
------------------
1. PROTOTYPE INTERFACE (ProtoType<T>):
   - Defines clone() method contract
   - Generic interface for type safety
   - Enables polymorphic cloning
   - Standardizes cloning behavior

2. CONCRETE PROTOTYPES (GamePiece, GameBoard):
   - Implement ProtoType interface
   - Provide specific cloning logic
   - Handle shallow vs deep cloning appropriately
   - Maintain object state consistency

3. CLIENT (Main):
   - Uses clone() method to create copies
   - Doesn't need to know concrete classes
   - Avoids complex object construction
   - Works with cloned objects independently

SHALLOW VS DEEP CLONING
-----------------------
SHALLOW CLONING:
- Copies object fields directly
- Shared references to mutable objects
- Changes to nested objects affect both copies
- Faster but potentially problematic

DEEP CLONING (Your Implementation):
- Recursively clones all nested objects
- Complete independence between copies
- Changes to nested objects don't affect other copies
- Slower but safer for complex objects

YOUR IMPLEMENTATION USES DEEP CLONING:
- GamePiece: Shallow clone (fields are primitive/immutable)
- GameBoard: Deep clone (clones each GamePiece individually)

WITHOUT PATTERN PROBLEMS
-------------------------
1. MANUAL COPYING COMPLEXITY:
   - Client must manually iterate through collections
   - Must know internal structure of objects
   - Must remember to copy ALL fields
   - Error-prone and tedious process

2. KNOWLEDGE DEPENDENCY:
   - Client must know constructor signatures
   - Must understand object relationships
   - Tight coupling between client and object structure
   - Violates encapsulation principle

3. CODE DUPLICATION:
   - Copy logic repeated wherever copying is needed
   - Same manual process in multiple places
   - Maintenance nightmare when objects change
   - No reusable copying mechanism

4. SCALABILITY ISSUES:
   - Adding new fields breaks existing copy code
   - Complex objects become unmanageable to copy
   - No standardized approach across different objects
   - Performance issues with repeated manual copying

5. ERROR PRONE:
   - Easy to forget fields during copying
   - Risk of shallow copying when deep copying needed
   - No compile-time checking for complete copying
   - Debugging copying issues is difficult

WITH PATTERN BENEFITS
---------------------
1. EASY CLONING:
   - Simple .clone() method call
   - No need to know object internals
   - Standardized cloning interface
   - Polymorphic cloning capability

2. DEEP CLONING SUPPORT:
   - Automatic deep cloning of complex objects
   - Ensures complete object independence
   - Handles nested object relationships
   - Prevents unintended object sharing

3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Avoids expensive object initialization
   - Reuses existing object state
   - Faster than complex construction
   - Reduces memory allocation overhead

4. ENCAPSULATION:
   - Hides cloning complexity from client
   - Objects manage their own cloning logic
   - No exposure of internal structure
   - Clean separation of concerns

5. EXTENSIBILITY:
   - Easy to add new cloneable objects
   - Consistent cloning interface
   - Can customize cloning behavior per class
   - Supports different cloning strategies

HOW YOUR IMPLEMENTATION WORKS
-----------------------------
1. Client calls: gameBoard.clone()
2. GameBoard.clone() creates new GameBoard instance
3. Iterates through all GamePieces in original board
4. Calls piece.clone() for each GamePiece (deep cloning)
5. Adds cloned pieces to new board
6. Returns completely independent GameBoard copy

EXECUTION FLOW
--------------
Client: gameBoard.clone()
    ↓
GameBoard.clone():
    ↓ creates new GameBoard()
    ↓ for each piece in pieces:
        ↓ calls piece.clone()
        ↓ GamePiece.clone() creates new GamePiece(position, color)
        ↓ adds cloned piece to new board
    ↓ returns new GameBoard with cloned pieces

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
-------------------
- Document Templates (Word, Excel templates)
- Game State Snapshots (save/load game states)
- Configuration Objects (clone settings for different environments)
- GUI Component Prototypes (clone UI elements with same properties)
- Database Record Templates (clone records with default values)
- Test Data Creation (clone test objects with variations)
- Undo/Redo Systems (clone object states for history)

PROTOTYPE PATTERN VARIATIONS
----------------------------
1. REGISTRY-BASED PROTOTYPE:
   - Central registry of prototype instances
   - Clone prototypes by name/key
   - Pre-configured prototype templates

2. ABSTRACT PROTOTYPE:
   - Abstract base class with clone method
   - Concrete prototypes extend base class
   - Shared cloning infrastructure

3. SHALLOW PROTOTYPE:
   - Simple field copying
   - Shared references to nested objects
   - Faster but less safe

4. DEEP PROTOTYPE (Your Implementation):
   - Recursive cloning of nested objects
   - Complete object independence
   - Safer but potentially slower

WHEN TO USE PROTOTYPE PATTERN

✓ Object creation is expensive or complex
✓ Need to create objects similar to existing ones
✓ Want to avoid subclassing for object creation
✓ Objects have many possible configurations
✓ Need to create independent copies of complex objects
✓ Runtime object creation based on existing instances
✓ Want to hide object creation complexity from client

WHEN NOT TO USE
---------------
✗ Simple objects with trivial construction
✗ Objects are immutable and sharing is acceptable
✗ Cloning is more expensive than construction
✗ Objects don't have complex state to preserve
✗ Memory usage is a critical concern
