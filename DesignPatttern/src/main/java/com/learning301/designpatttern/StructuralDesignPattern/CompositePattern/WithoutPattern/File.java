 * File - WITHOUT Composite Pattern

 * 1. NO COMMON INTERFACE - Cannot treat files and folders uniformly
 * 2. DIFFERENT METHOD NAMES - showFile() vs showFiles() in Folder
 * 3. TYPE-SPECIFIC HANDLING - Client must know object type
 * 4. NO POLYMORPHISM - Cannot write generic code for both types
 * 5. POOR EXTENSIBILITY - Adding new types requires client changes
