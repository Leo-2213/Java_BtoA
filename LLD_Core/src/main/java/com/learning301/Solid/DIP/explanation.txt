## Analysis of DIP Implementation

### Bad Code Implementation
In the BadCode package, there's a violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle:

1. The `NotificationService` class directly depends on concrete implementations (`EmailService` and `SmsService`).
2. The high-level module (`NotificationService`) is tightly coupled to low-level modules.
3. Adding a new notification type (like WhatsApp) would require modifying the `NotificationService` class.
4. Each notification type has its own specific method (`sendEmail()`, `sendSms()`), making the service less flexible.

### Good Code Implementation
The GoodCode package correctly applies the Dependency Inversion Principle:

1. It introduces an abstraction (`NotificationController` interface) that both high-level and low-level modules depend on.
2. The `NotificationService` (high-level module) depends on the abstraction, not concrete implementations.
3. Concrete implementations (`EmailService`, `SmsService`, `WhatsappService`) implement the common interface.
4. The `NotificationService` has a generic `sendNotification()` method that works with any implementation.
5. New notification types can be added without modifying existing code (as demonstrated with `WhatsappService`).

## Key Benefits of DIP

1. **Abstraction**: Both high and low-level modules depend on abstractions.
2. **Decoupling**: The high-level module (`NotificationService`) is decoupled from specific implementations.
3. **Flexibility**: New notification types can be added without changing existing code.
4. **Polymorphism**: The system uses polymorphic behavior through the interface.
5. **Testability**: The design is more testable as dependencies can be easily mocked.

This example effectively demonstrates the two key aspects of DIP:
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
