## Analysis of LSP Implementation

### Bad Code Implementation
In the BadCode package, there's a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle:

1. The `Bird` interface assumes all birds can fly by including a `fly()` method.
2. The `Ostrich` class implements `Bird` but cannot properly fulfill the `fly()` method since ostriches cannot fly in reality.
3. The `Ostrich` implementation either gives misleading output ("Ostrich cannot fly") or could throw an exception.
4. This means an `Ostrich` cannot be substituted for a `Bird` without affecting program behavior.
5. Even though `Cookoo` can properly implement the `fly()` method, the overall hierarchy is flawed.

### Good Code Implementation
The GoodCode package correctly applies the Liskov Substitution Principle:

1. The base `Bird` interface includes only methods that all birds can implement correctly (like `eat()`).
2. A specialized `FlyingBirds` interface extends `Bird` and adds the `fly()` method.
3. `Ostrich` implements only the `Bird` interface since it cannot fly.
4. `Cookoo` implements the `FlyingBirds` interface since it can both eat and fly.
5. This hierarchy ensures that any subtype can be substituted for its base type without affecting program behavior.

## Key Benefits of LSP

1. **Behavioral Correctness**: Subtypes guarantee the behavior expected by clients of the base type.
2. **No Surprises**: No unexpected exceptions or incorrect behavior when using subtypes.
3. **Proper Hierarchy**: Class hierarchy reflects real-world capabilities.
4. **Code Reusability**: Code that works with base types works correctly with all subtypes.
5. **Design Clarity**: Clear separation between different types of behaviors.

This example effectively demonstrates the core principle of LSP:
- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
