## Analysis of OCP Implementation

### Bad Code Implementation
In the BadCode package, there's a violation of the Open-Closed Principle:

1. The `PaymentProcessor` class uses conditional logic (if-else statements) to handle different payment types.
2. To add a new payment method (e.g., "Bitcoin"), the existing `processPayment` method must be modified.
3. This violates OCP because the class is not closed for modification when new payment types are added.
4. Each new payment type requires changes to the core processing logic.
5. The code is difficult to maintain and prone to errors as it grows with more payment types.

### Good Code Implementation
The GoodCode package correctly applies the Open-Closed Principle:

1. It defines a `PaymentMethod` interface with a `pay()` method.
2. Concrete payment methods (`CreditCard`, `DebitCard`, `UPI`) implement this interface.
3. The `PaymentProcessor` class accepts any `PaymentMethod` implementation and calls its `pay()` method.
4. To add a new payment method, you simply create a new class implementing `PaymentMethod`.
5. The `PaymentProcessor` class remains unchanged when new payment methods are added.

## Key Benefits of OCP

1. **Extensibility**: New functionality can be added without modifying existing code.
2. **Reduced Risk**: Existing, tested code remains untouched when adding new features.
3. **Maintainability**: Code is more modular and easier to understand.
4. **Testability**: New implementations can be tested in isolation.
5. **Flexibility**: The system can evolve without breaking existing functionality.

This example effectively demonstrates the core principle of OCP:
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
